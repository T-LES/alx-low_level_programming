The file named 0-main.c tests that the function
positive_or_negative() gives the correct output when given
case of 0

In this file 1-main.c, I have comment the part of the code
that is causing the output to go into an infinite loop.

The code in 2-largest_number.c prints the largest of three
numbers, no matter the case.
